    1. Use it when a class in your program should have only one instance that will be available from anywhere in the code.
    2. Use it when you need stricter control over the global variables. Unlike global variables, the Singleton pattern guarantees that there‚Äôs just one instance of a class. Nothing, except for the Singleton class itself, can replace the cached instance.

    Here we use the Singleton pattern to create an AuthManager. Every time we sign in or log out we store a value in a ‚ÄúisSignedIn‚Äù variable using UserDefaults. Note that UserDefaults class also the Singleton. So, when we open the app it goes to this source of truth and asks it what value it has. Based on what we get back (either true or false) application opens an Authorization screen or Home screen. We also store username in the Singleton class. So later you can access it in any part of the app or change it if you need it.
